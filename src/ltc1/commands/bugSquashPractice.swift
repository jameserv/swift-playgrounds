/* Challenge: Reorder the commands to debug the code.

In this challenge, you'll practice your bug-finding skills by finding and rearranging the commands that are out of
order in the code below.

Watch out!
Notice that one of the switches on this map starts out open. If Byte toggles that switch closed, it's a bug in your
code. You need all switches toggled open to complete the challenge.

It's a good idea to run your code every tim you make a change, to make sure you've located and fixed each bug. Don't
worry if you end up trying many times. Making mistakes is actually one of the best ways to learn something new and
remember it for a long time!
